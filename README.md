# Vue ToDo - Back to Basics
Sometimes you jump into a new langage being thrown into a project and having to learn as you go.  While this can definitely teach you a lot, it can also cause you to skip over important basics and leave you with a less robust understanding of the language.

This is what happened to me with Vue.  In this project I'm going through a Vue Basics tutorial on Laracasts: [Learn Vue Step by Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-3-step-by-step) to relearn Vue from scratch to make sure I'm not missing any important details.


## Notes about the project

**No Build or Dev script yet - for now using simple https server**

use `npx serve` to start it


**Also using a simple fake api with json server**

`npm install json-server --save-dev` 

`npx json serer`
